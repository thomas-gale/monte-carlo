# monte-carlo
Learning about Monte Carlo methods.

## stack
- `rust` language
- `wgpu` binding library
- `wgsl` shader language

## plan
- [ ] Follow (again) https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html implementing as much code as wgsl fragment/compute shaders
- [ ] Extend to https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html
- [ ] Explore https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheRestOfYourLife.html
- [ ] Move to the fascinating monte carlo/wos papers and try to generalise the wgsl compute shaders to do other (non ray tracing) monte carlo based simulations sampling e.g. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/MonteCarloGeometryProcessing/index.html & https://cs.dartmouth.edu/wjarosz/publications/sawhneyseyb22gridfree.html
